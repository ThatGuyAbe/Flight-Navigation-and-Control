# Flight-Navigation-and-Control
This repository contains all the code for my senior design project.

The file called deepface is the facial recogniton program that will be implemented. 
The imu file is the program that outputs the yaw, pitch, and roll for BNO085 IMU.
The obstical file is the program setups all five VL53L1X sensors and outputs distance.
The RC_fly file is the program the sets up the MSP communication between the raspberry pi zero 2 w with the Betaflight controller. It then arms the drone, sends RC values, and disarms the drone.
